## Intro

Hello my name is Stefan Fleck and I work for the transport  unit
at statistics austria. In 2019 we developed a mobile app for the road freight
transport survey as an alternative to the traditional questionnaire.
The app can automatically fill in some of the data we need by analyzing the
geo-locations recorded by the mobile device, thus leaving fewer questions for
the respondent to answer and saving them valuable time. 

This talk is about how and why we implemented the processing of the location data
in R and set up a web service to make this functionality available to the
backend of the mobile app.

## TOC

1. i will start by discussing how we solved the problem of deriving travel distance from position data.
2. next i will explain why we decided to choose a web service for deploying our code 
3. and then I will describe the actual service we implented
4. Finally a I will close the presentation with a conclusion and recommend
  some additional reading if you want to deepen your understanding of web
  services.

As this talk is rather short, I can only skim the topics listed above, but
I am happy to Answer questions afterwards.

For the statistics we publish we need to know the total distance of each journey
and potentially all transitioned countries and border crossings. This can
be derived from location data, but its not completely straight forward.

The mobile app records the global position of the device as latitude and 
longitude. Usually we get one such geo-position every few seconds, depending on
the device. As you can see on the maps, the data is not always perfect and
there are outliers that we have to remove and gaps that we have to close.
These gaps can be large for phones with aggressive power saving settings and
sometimes we only get a few points towards the beginning and end of a journey.

In the end we came up with the following algorithm for processing our data.
First we remove points where the positional accuracy reported by the
mobile phone is less than 20 meters. Then we remove points where the speed of
the vehicle is less than 7 kilometers per hour. We do this to remove things like
rest breaks from the joruney, where the driver left his vehicle but did notd
deactive the app.
We also remove points where the speed is greater than 130 kilometers per hour.
This has prooven very effective at removing outliers

We then connect the remaining points with straight lines if they are close
together, or use an external routing service to connect points that are further
than 50 meters apart. This algorithm produces very good results for most of the
journeys that we receive from the mobile app users, however, our work is far
from done. The question that we have to answer now, is

how can we deploy the algorithm in a production environment? Note that new
journeys can arrive at any time during the day and should be processed
within a few minutes. 

A feasible approach would be making an R script that is callable from the
command line and deploying it to the machine where the backend of the mobile
up runs. This has several disadvantages. It pushes the responsibility for
maintaining the R environment to the team that developed the mobile app 
and makes the whole setup for the backend more complicated and interlinked.
This also means that the app team would always need to be involved if the
modifications to the script become necessary. 

The solution we chose was setting up a stand-alone web-service that is isolated 
from the mobile app and its backend. This way the development and maintenance
of the geoprocessing service is indipendent from the development cycles of the 
moible app, and updating and testing the R code is pretty simple.
